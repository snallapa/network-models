# Network Models

This is a website that shows some simple network models. As of now the ones included are the Erdos Renyi, Watts Strogatz, and Barabasi Albert. Some plans I had was to expand into a more 'simulation' mode where you can see step by step graph creations and also have more control over the current simulation on charges, forces, and so on.. Here is the link to the website https://snallapa.github.io/network-models/
